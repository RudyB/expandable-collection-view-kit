# üç± Features
- **Ease of use**
    - Instantiate `ExpandableCollectionViewManager` class, provide its parent view controller and specify the `Folders` and `Items`.
- **Flexible API**
    - There are many customization points that can be used to adjust: `Folders`, `Items`, `Navigation`, `appeareances` and also custom `animations`.
    - Swift's `Function Builders` make it very easy to create a tree of interconnected items 
- **Autolayout**
    - You don't need to do anything related to autolayout - the component properly handles all the changes. The only thing you need to do is to instantiate the `ExpandableCollectionViewManager` and fill it in with items.
- **Performant**
    - The under-the-hood implementation uses Swift's `Diffable Data Sources` and `Collection View Compositional Layout` which provides high performance and tested backing APi.
- **Extendable**
    - The component can be futher extended with new types of items, `Function Builder` types (such as `For Each` that applies a group of modifiers to a set of items, rather than copy-pasting the same modifiers or managing boilderplate configuration), decoratable content views for items and the list goes on. 
  

# üìö Usage

## Instantiation

### Basic
Create a property that will hold the  `ExpandableCollectionViewManager` reference and the instantiate it via one of the designated initializers:

```swift
let expVCManager = ExpandableCollectionViewManager(parentViewController: self)
```
Here `self` is the reference to the `UIViewController`  where the property is used.
